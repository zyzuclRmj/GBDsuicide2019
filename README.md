# GBDsuicide2019
This repository is created for publication of article "Absolute and age-relative suicide-rates for women and men age 60 years and older, at the global, region, and nation level, 1990-2019: a systematic analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 data" on the Nature Mental Health.

Code for manuscript: It is the script that included codes for the calculation of estimates of age-standardized suicide rates and rate ratios and their uncertainty intervals. It included the codes for generation of following tables and figures in the manuscript:
   - Table 1. Number of OA suicides, ASSR per 100,000, percent-change from 1990 to 2019 with UI, and OA-NOA suicide ratios in 2019 for all regions.
   - Table 2. ASSR and percent-change between 1990 and 2019 among individuals age 60 and older in 5-year age groups.
   - Table 3. ASSR ratio for individuals age 60 and older by  5-year groups relative to individuals ages 10 to 59 years as well as the percent change in ASSR ratios between 1990 and 2019.
   - Figure 1. OA ASSR by super regions, age groups and gender in 2019.
   - Figure 2. Temporal trends of OA-NOA suicide ratios by super regions and gender from 1990 to 2019.   
   - Figure 3. Age-specific OA-NOA suicide ratio by super region, age groups, and gender in 2019.
   - Figure 4. Age-standardized OA-NOA suicide ratio by SDI across super regions in 2019.
   - Figure 5. Percent change of ASSR by country SDI, in five OA age-groups. 

Code for appendix: It is a script file for world map of distribution of elder suicide rates and rate ratios. It includes codes for generation of world maps and tables:
  - Appendix Figure S1. Age-standardized suicide-rates (ASSR) globally (all age groups), 2019.
  - Appendix Figure S2. Percentage change in age-standardized suicide-rates (ASSR) globally (all age groups) between 1990 and 2019.
  - Appendix Figure S3. Global OA-NOA suicide-rates ratio in 2019.
  - Appendix Table S1. Total number of older adult (OA) suicides, OA age-standardized suicide-rates (ASSR) per 100,000 in 1990 and 2019, total percent change in OA ASSR from 1990 to 2019, with uncertainty intervals (UI), and older-adult to non-older-adult (OA-NOA) suicide-rates ratios, in 2019, for all countries.
